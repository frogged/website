Graphical installation with vh_gui
==================

In order to start the hub you must first run a configuration script called _vh\_gui_. In order to execute it you must have _dialog_ utility installed ([http://invisible-island.net/dialog/dialog.html](http://invisible-island.net/dialog/dialog.html "Dialog")).
If the previous steps of this manual has been completed successfully then you should be able to run the following script:

    vh_gui --install

Now you have to provide some information to create database for VerliHub: database name, nickname, password and finally the hostname for MySQL server (it is _localhost_ if you are running MySQL from the same server of the hub). You can move up/down with keyword arrows to select the different fields. Press enter to confirm the information and to go on in the next step.


Setup will now verify if account and database already exist on MySQL server, otherwise they will be created. The installation process will ask you to provide information for administration account.

Now press OK and confirm the data as shown in the above screenshot. If all data are correct, the next step is to specify the VerliHub configuration folder which will contain a configuration file and other files needed to run the hub. This is shown in the following screenshot:

The installation process provides you some locations for VerliHub configuration folder. You can choose one or providing another by selecting the option _Other_ . Remember that you need **write permission** to create files in that folder, otherwise setup will tell you to choose another path.
You can also use an existing config folder and setup will made a backup of any data stored into it (dbconfig, trigger, plugins).
The setup in the following step will create database tables and all needed files as shown in the following screenshot:

Press enter to confirm each information you provide. Then type _y_ to confirm again the information and to go on in the next step.
