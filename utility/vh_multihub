Structure of config file
==================
All hubs are stored inside a config file called verlihub.conf and it is located in /etc/ folder.
This file is structured like /etc/passwd file. Each line represents an hub entry and one line contains the following values separeted by a comma (;):

    CONFIG_PATH:NICKNAME:PROCESS_OWNER:DATE

where

- CONFIG_PATH is the complete path to dbconfig file of the hub
- NICKNAME is just a reference to the hub (for i.e. the hub owner)
- PROCESS_OWNER is the username that should run the process (you can use this value if you want to allow server access with different users)
- DATE the unix timestamp of the last changes

Please **do not edit** this file directly but use the options of vh_multihub script.
