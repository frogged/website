The ulimit command provides control over the resources available to the shell and/or to processes started by it, on systems that allow such control. 
If you have a hub with thousands of users, they can be disconnected from the hub because of ulimit.

If you run the hub as root you can't set the ulimit to an unlimited value:

	ulimit -n <users>

<users> should be a number and if you set it to 20000, Linux will limit the max number of open connections to 20000.

If you are running the hub as normal user, you must tell the system to allow a soft and hard limit for that user.
In this case you need to edit the file **/etc/security/limits.conf** and adding the following lines:

	username soft nofile 20480 
	username hard nofile 20480 

where username is the name of the user with whom you are running the hub. Then next time you login with that user and type ulimit -n command, you will see the new limit.
