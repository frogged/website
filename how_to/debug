Here a guide how to debug Verlihub in case it crashes.

First of all install the debugger tool gdb. Then start verlihub with:

	gdb verlihub 2>&1 | tee ~/gdb-verlihub.txt

It will prompt you in gdb console something like this: 

	netcelli@amd ~ $ gdb verlihub 2>&1 | tee ~/gdb-verlihub.txt

	GNU gdb 6.8

	This GDB was configured as "x86_64-pc-linux-gnu"...
	(gdb)

Now start the process by typing "run" and press enter. GDB will start Verlihub in debug mode, that means you can see Verlihub logs in your console. Wait for a crash and in gdb console type:

	(gdb) backtrace full
	(gdb) info registers
	(gdb) x/16i $pc
	(gdb) thread apply all backtrace
	(gdb) quit

This will save a lot of debug info in gdb-verlihub.txt file to understand why the process just crashed. Send that file to [Git hub issues page](https://github.com/verlihub/verlihub-1.0.0/issues/).

Also since version 1.0.0 hub will attempt to send crash backtrace to [Verlihub Crash Server](http://crash.verlihub.net/) via HTTP protocol, or in case of failure write it to error log file.
