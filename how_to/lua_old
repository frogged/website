~NOTOC~
If you have installed Lua 5.0.x library from source, current Makefile does not support uninstall target; that means you can't uninstall it automactly  by typing:

    make uninstall


Suppose Lua library is installed in default location (/usr/local), the following files are installed:

> ./bin/lua (the interpreter)

> ./bin/luac (the compiler)

> liblua.a and liblualib.a in ./lib (the libraries)

> lua.h and lualib.h in ./include. (include files)

To remove them type (as root):

    cd /usr/local

    rm bin/lua bin/luac lib/liblua.a lib/liblualib.a include/lua.h include/lualib.h

And it's done. Now you can upgrade to Lua 5.1.x library if you want.
